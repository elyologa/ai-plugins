# Bitwarden Software Architect Plugin

## Overview

Software architecture planning for Bitwarden repositories. Generic AI assistance doesn't know our zero-knowledge constraints, multi-client reality, dual-ORM strategy, or V+/-2 version matrix. This plugin keeps architecture decisions grounded in how we actually build software at Bitwarden.

## Agent

| Agent                 | What It Does                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bitwarden-architect` | Produces implementation plans grounded in Bitwarden's architectural principles |

## Skills

| Skill                    | What It Does                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `architecting-solutions` | Principal engineer perspective on architecture decisions. Provides the architectural judgment framework applied across all planning. |

## Cross-Plugin Integration

| Plugin                        | How It's Used                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bitwarden-security-engineer` | Security context (P01-P06), architecture pattern review, threat modeling |
| `bitwarden-product-analyst`   | Consumes requirements documents as upstream input                        |
| `bitwarden-software-engineer` | Implementation conventions for server, client, and database decisions    |
| `bitwarden-atlassian-tools`   | Jira issue research and Confluence page access                           |

All cross-plugin skills are required because we rely upon each of them for a rich, complete workflow.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install bitwarden-architect@bitwarden-marketplace
```

## Usage

The architect agent activates when you need to plan a feature, review an architecture decision, assess blast radius, or produce an implementation plan:

```
Plan the implementation for PM-12345
```

```
Review the architecture of [feature area] and suggest improvements
```

```
Assess the blast radius of adding [capability] to [service]
```

## How It Works

1. **Context Discovery**: Reads the repo's CLAUDE.md to learn architecture constraints, security rules, and available skills
2. **Skill Invocation**: Finds and invokes the repo's planning skill (e.g., `planning-android-implementation`, `planning-ios-implementation`) for platform-specific guidance
3. **Gap Analysis**: Evaluates technical gaps (security, SDK, extensions, data migration, performance)
4. **Codebase Exploration**: Deploys sub-agents to find existing patterns and similar implementations
5. **Plan Production**: Outputs a standardized Implementation Plan with phased tasks, file manifest, and risk assessment

## Deliverables

- **Implementation Plan** (`{slug}-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`) — Architecture design, phased task breakdown, file manifest, risk assessment
- **Work Breakdown Document** (`{slug}-WORK-BREAKDOWN.md`) — Jira-ready tasks consolidating product and technical breakdowns
- **Architecture Review** — Verification of implementation adherence to the plan
