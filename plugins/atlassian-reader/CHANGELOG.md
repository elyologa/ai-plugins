The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- Remove redundant `skills` field from `plugin.json`; skills are auto-discovered from the `skills/` directory

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- Cross-plugin skill awareness: skill now suggests invoking security engineer `bitwarden-security-context` for security-tagged tickets and software engineer skills for validating technical specs against Bitwarden conventions when sibling plugins are installed

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **JQL Search endpoint migration**: Updated from removed `/rest/api/3/search` to `/rest/api/3/search/jql` per Atlassian [CHANGE-2046](https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/#CHANGE-2046)
- **Pagination guidance**: Updated Section 5 to use cursor-based `isLast` field instead of legacy `total` for the new search endpoint

### Added

- **Acceptance Criteria field**: Issue reads now fetch `customfield_10192` (Bitwarden's A/C field) and presentation instructions prioritize it over description-embedded A/C
- **Epic children discovery**: Section 3 now instructs agents to perform a JQL `parent =` search when reading Epics/Features, since next-gen projects don't populate `subtasks`
- **API deprecation error handling**: Section 11 error table now covers `200 with errorMessages` responses for removed/deprecated endpoints

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Initial release with read-only Jira and Confluence access via scoped API tokens
- Jira: issue reading, comments, JQL search, boards and sprints
- Confluence: page reading, CQL search, child page listing
- Error handling and context-aware summarization
