### Changed

- Agent now autonomously drives full implementation lifecycle with self-review protocol (implement, test, build, preflight, commit)
- Added dynamic context discovery via CLAUDE.md Skills & Commands table — agent discovers and invokes repo-local skills at runtime
- Added `Agent` and `Skill` (bare) to tools for dynamic discovery and sub-agent deployment

- Replaces per-repo implementer agents (`android-implementer`, `ios-implementer`)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-23
