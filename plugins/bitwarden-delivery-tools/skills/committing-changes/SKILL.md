# Git Commit Conventions

## Commit Message Format

```
[PM-XXXXX] <type>: <imperative summary>

<optional body explaining why, not what>
```

### Rules

1. **Ticket prefix**: Always include `[PM-XXXXX]` matching the Jira ticket
2. **Type keyword**: Select from the table below. The keyword drives automatic `t:` label assignment via CI (`.github/scripts/label-pr.py` reads `.github/label-pr.json`). CI matches `<type>:` or `<type>(` in the lowercased title.

| Type | Label | Use for |
|------|-------|---------|
| `feat` | `t:feature` | New features or functionality |
| `fix` | `t:bug` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor` | `t:tech-debt` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `chore` | `t:tech-debt` | Maintenance, cleanup, minor tweaks |
| `test` | `t:tech-debt` | Adding or updating tests |
| `perf` | `t:tech-debt` | Performance improvements |
| `docs` | `t:docs` | Documentation changes |
| `ci` / `build` | `t:ci` | CI/CD and build system changes |
| `deps` | `t:deps` | Dependency updates |
| `llm` | `t:llm` | LLM/Claude configuration changes |
| `breaking` | `t:breaking-change` | Breaking changes requiring migration |
| `misc` | `t:misc` | Changes that do not fit other categories |

CI also accepts aliases (e.g., `revert`, `bugfix`, `cleanup`). See `.github/label-pr.json` for the full mapping. **If the type cannot be confidently determined, ask the user.**

### Examples

```
[PM-12345] feat: Add biometric unlock timeout configuration

Users reported confusion about when biometric prompts appear.
This adds a configurable timeout setting to the security preferences.
```

Ambiguous cases — choosing between similar types:
```
# Refactor that also fixes a bug? Use the primary intent:
[PM-12345] fix: Resolve null pointer in vault sync retry logic

# Test-only change:
[PM-12345] test: Add unit tests for biometric timeout edge cases
```

### Followup Commits

Only the first commit on a branch needs the full format (ticket prefix, type keyword, body). Subsequent commits can use a short, descriptive summary with no prefix or body required.

```
Update error handling in login flow
```

## Pre-Commit Quality Gate

Before staging, run the `perform-preflight` skill for the full quality gate checklist (tests, lint, security, architecture). Consult the repo's CLAUDE.md for platform-specific build and lint commands.
