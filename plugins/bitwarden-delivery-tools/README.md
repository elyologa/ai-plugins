# Bitwarden Delivery Tools

Generic delivery workflow skills for committing, PR creation, preflight checks, and change labeling across any Bitwarden repository.

## Overview

These skills define the delivery **process** — commit formats, PR workflows, quality gates, and labeling conventions. Platform-specific details (build commands, lint tools, test runners) are discovered dynamically from each repo's CLAUDE.md.

## Skills

| Skill | Triggers | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `committing-changes` | "commit", "stage changes" | Commit message format, staging best practices |
| `creating-pull-request` | "create PR", "open PR" | PR title/body format, draft workflow, AI review labels |
| `labeling-changes` | "label", "change type" | Conventional commit type keywords, CI label mapping |
| `perform-preflight` | "preflight", "self review" | Pre-commit quality gate checklist |

## Design Principle

Each skill owns the **workflow** (what steps to follow, what format to use). The repo's CLAUDE.md owns the **platform specifics** (which linter to run, which test command to use, which security rules apply). This separation allows the same skills to work across Android, iOS, Server, SDK, and Clients repos.
