# Requirements Elicitation

## Purpose
Extract complete, unambiguous requirements from user specifications, stakeholder inputs, and technical documentation, identifying what needs to be built while clarifying unclear or missing information.

## When to Use
- Analyzing new feature requests or enhancement specifications
- Processing GitHub issues into structured requirements
- Breaking down large features into detailed components
- Identifying missing, unclear, or conflicting information
- Reviewing technical specifications for completeness

## Key Capabilities
1. **Extract Requirements** — Identify functional and non-functional requirements from multiple sources
2. **Clarify Ambiguities** — Flag unclear specifications and formulate targeted questions
3. **Identify Constraints** — Find technical, business, security, and resource limitations
4. **Categorize Requirements** — Organize by type (functional, non-functional, security, performance)

## Approach

### 1. Read and Understand
- Read entire specification thoroughly, including all referenced documents
- Identify the primary source (main requirement) vs. supporting documentation
- Note the scope and context of the request

### 2. Extract Explicit Requirements
- Capture clearly stated requirements
- Document exact specifications (API signatures, data formats, performance metrics)
- Preserve technical details verbatim

### 3. Identify Implicit Requirements
- Infer unstated but necessary requirements (e.g., error handling, validation, logging)
- Consider security implications based on Bitwarden security principles (P01-P06)
- Identify data classification needs (Vault Data, Protected Data, secure channels)

### 4. Flag Ambiguities and Gaps
- Document unclear or missing information
- Formulate specific questions to resolve ambiguities
- Identify conflicting requirements between sources
- Note assumptions being made

### 5. Document Constraints
- Technical constraints (APIs, platforms, compatibility)
- Security constraints (data protection, authentication, authorization)
- Resource constraints (performance, storage, bandwidth)
- Business constraints (timeline, scope, dependencies)

### 6. Create Acceptance Criteria
- For each requirement, define testable acceptance criteria
- Specify verification methods (commands, tests, manual checks)
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

## Bitwarden-Specific Considerations

### Security Requirements
Always consider and document:
- **Data classification** — Is this Vault Data, Protected Data, or other?
- **Data states** — Requirements for data at rest, in use, in transit
- **Security channels** — Need for secure/trusted channels?
- **Security principles** — Which principles (P01-P06) apply?
- **Threat scenarios** — What could go wrong?

### Common Bitwarden Requirement Types
- **Authentication/Authorization** — Who can access what?
- **Encryption** — What data needs protection and how?
- **Zero-knowledge** — Server must not have access to plaintext (P01)
- **Cross-platform** — Works on all Bitwarden clients?
- **Backwards compatibility** — Maintains existing behavior?

## Example: Export Functionality

**Context**: Feature request to "add export functionality"

**Requirements Elicitation Process**:

1. **Functional Requirements** (extract):
   - System shall allow users to export vault data
   - [QUESTION: What data? All items, selected items, specific vaults?]
   - [QUESTION: What formats? JSON, CSV, encrypted export?]

2. **Non-Functional Requirements** (identify):
   - **Performance**: Export operation shall complete within 30 seconds for vaults with <10,000 items
   - [QUESTION: What's the max vault size to support?]
   - **Usability**: Export progress shall be visible to user
   - [QUESTION: Should this be cancellable?]

3. **Security Requirements** (apply Bitwarden principles):
   - **Data Classification**: This is Vault Data export (P05: Controlled Access)
   - **User Consent**: Explicit user confirmation required (data exporting nullifies guarantees)
   - **Format Security**:
     - Unencrypted export → Warning about data leaking risk
     - Encrypted export → Key derivation and storage requirements
   - [QUESTION: Should we limit export frequency or add audit logging?]

4. **Constraints** (identify):
   - **Technical**: Must work across all clients (web, desktop, mobile, CLI)
   - **Compatibility**: Export format must be importable by all Bitwarden clients
   - **Storage**: Large exports may need temporary disk space (how much?)

5. **Acceptance Criteria** (define):
   - User can trigger export from vault menu
   - User receives clear warning about security implications
   - User can select export format
   - Export completes successfully with all selected data
   - Exported file can be imported back without data loss
   - User can cancel in-progress export

6. **Open Questions** (document):
   - What data fields to include in each format?
   - Size limits for export?
   - Audit trail requirements?
   - Mobile-specific considerations (storage permissions, file sharing)?

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Ask "what" questions, not "how" — Focus on requirements, not implementation
- ✅ Document assumptions explicitly — Make implicit knowledge visible
- ✅ Create testable acceptance criteria — Avoid vague success measures
- ✅ Consider all user types — Free users, premium, enterprise, admins
- ✅ Think about edge cases — Empty vaults, huge vaults, network failures
- ✅ Reference Bitwarden security principles — Ground security requirements in P01-P06
- ✅ Use Bitwarden vocabulary — Standard terminology for data, channels, security

### Don'ts
- ❌ Avoid: Making technical implementation decisions — That's the architect's job
- ❌ Avoid: Assuming unstated requirements are obvious — Explicit is better
- ❌ Avoid: Generic acceptance criteria — "It works" is not testable
- ❌ Avoid: Ignoring security implications — Security is never optional at Bitwarden
- ❌ Avoid: Skipping constraints — They're as important as requirements

## Output Format

Organize extracted requirements in structured sections:

```markdown
## Functional Requirements
1. REQ-F-001: [Specific capability the system must have]
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: [Testable condition]
   - **Priority**: Critical | High | Medium | Low

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput, resource usage]
- **Reliability**: [Error handling, edge cases, availability]
- **Compatibility**: [Platform support, backwards compatibility]
- **Usability**: [User experience expectations]

## Security Requirements
- **Data Classification**: [Vault Data | Protected Data | Other]
- **Security Principles**: [P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06 as applicable]
- **Threat Considerations**: [What could go wrong?]

## Constraints
- **Technical**: [APIs, platforms, dependencies]
- **Business**: [Timeline, scope, resources]
- **Security**: [Compliance, encryption, authentication]

## Open Questions
1. [Specific question needing stakeholder input]
2. [Ambiguity requiring clarification]
3. [Missing information that blocks complete specification]

## Assumptions
- [Assumption 1: explicit statement of what's assumed]
- [Assumption 2: should be validated with stakeholders]
```

## Integration with Work Breakdown

After extracting requirements, use the `work-breakdown` skill to:
- Organize requirements into implementable phases
- Identify dependencies between requirements
- Create actionable tasks for implementation teams
