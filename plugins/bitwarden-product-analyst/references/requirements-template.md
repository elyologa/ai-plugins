- [Feature Y] — Not needed for this use case
- [Feature Z] — Deferred to future iteration

---

## Open Questions
> Items that need answers before implementation begins.
> If questions remain unanswered, implementation should not start.

1. [Question about design approach or architecture]
2. [Question about API/interface decisions]
3. [Question about platform-specific behavior]
4. [Question about security or privacy considerations]

---

## Constraints & Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- **Must not break**: [Existing features or behaviors that must remain intact]
- **Must use**: [Specific APIs, patterns, or technologies required]
- **Must maintain**: [Backwards compatibility requirements, data format compatibility]
- **Platform limitations**: [iOS restrictions, browser API limitations, etc.]

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: [Deadlines or target release dates]
- **Resources**: [Team availability, budget constraints]
- **External dependencies**: [Third-party services, legal requirements]

### Existing Customer Impact & Migration
- **Deprecation**: Is this replacing or removing any existing product functionality? Has leadership signed off?
- **Migration plan**: If yes, how will existing users/data be migrated?
- **Communication plan**: Does this require proactive customer communication?
  - Channels to consider: in-app messaging, email, Reddit, Bitwarden Community forums, social media
  - Timing: before release, at release, or post-release?

### Team Considerations
> Identify all teams required to deliver this initiative.

- **Which teams are needed?** (e.g., Platform, Vault, Admin Console, Mobile, CLI, SM, Data, DevOps, CloudOps, Security, GTM)
- **Data team**: Are there analytics instrumentation, pipeline, or reporting needs?
- **Infrastructure (DevOps / CloudOps)**: Are there infrastructure, deployment, or scaling requirements?
- **Enablement work**: Is backend/platform work required before user-facing work can start? If so, is it scoped to less than one quarter?
- **Staffing approach**: What is the best way to staff this across teams to deliver fastest?
- **Alternative solutions**: Have we explored all possible solutions and time-to-market tradeoffs? Is there a lower-effort path?

## Security & Safety Considerations

### Data Classification
- **Vault Data**: [Is this feature handling user vault data? How?]
- **Protected Data**: [What data needs encryption? Key management?]
- **Data in Transit**: [Secure channel or trusted channel requirements?]

### Encryption & Sync
- **Encryption boundary**: Where is data encrypted/decrypted? (Must be client-side for vault data — never on the server)
- **Key material involved**: Master key / organization key / Send key / other?
- **Sync impact**: Does this add or change sync payloads? How does it affect offline mode?
- **Server knowledge**: Can the server read any of this data? (Zero-knowledge check — server must remain blind to vault contents)

### Security Principles
> All six principles must be considered. Document how this feature upholds each, or explicitly note "Not applicable" with justification.

- **P01 (Zero Knowledge)**: [How does this maintain server zero-knowledge? Server must never see plaintext vault data.]
- **P02 (Locked Vault Security)**: [How does this respect locked vault state? What is accessible when vault is locked?]
- **P03 (Trust Hierarchy)**: [How does this interact with org owners, admins, managers, members, and providers?]
- **P04 (Cryptographic Safety)**: [What cryptographic operations are involved? Are they client-side only? Which algorithms/key types?]
- **P05 (Controlled Access)**: [What access controls are implemented? How are permissions enforced?]
- **P06 (Transparency)**: [Audit logging implications? Open-source considerations? What is logged and where?]

### Threat Considerations
- [What could go wrong from a security perspective?]
- [What attack vectors exist?]
- [What mitigations are in place?]
- [Is formal threat modeling required? (Create separate security definition document)]

### Data Validation
- [What inputs need validation?]
- [What are the validation rules?]
- [How are invalid inputs handled?]

### Error Handling
- [How are errors surfaced to users?]
- [What error information is logged?]
- [Are there any sensitive data leakage risks in errors?]

### Resource Management
- [Are there resource limits (memory, disk, network)?]
- [How is cleanup handled (files, connections, sessions)?]
- [What happens on unexpected termination?]

### Organization & Collection Model Impact
- Does this feature apply to personal vaults, organization vaults, or both?
- How does it interact with Collection permissions and access policies?
- How does behavior differ across roles: Owner, Admin, Manager, Member, Custom?
- Provider Portal / MSP considerations (if applicable)?
- Does this feature require new permission types or collection-level controls?

### Enterprise Policy Controls
> Complete this section if the feature has admin-configurable behavior.

- Does this feature need a corresponding organizational policy?
- What can organization admins enforce, restrict, or require?
- What is the behavior when a policy is active vs. inactive?
- Does policy enforcement apply to existing members retroactively or only new logins?

### Feature Flag
- **Flag name**: `[feature-name-enabled]`
- **Rollout strategy**: Internal → Beta → GA
- **Kill switch behavior**: What happens to users mid-rollout if the flag is disabled?
- **Self-hosted flag behavior**: Does the flag apply to self-hosted instances?

## UI/UX Considerations
> If this feature has user-facing components

### User Interaction Flow
1. [Step 1: User does X]
2. [Step 2: System responds with Y]
3. [Step 3: User sees Z]

### Input/Output Format
- **Inputs**: [What data does user provide? Format? Validation?]
- **Outputs**: [What feedback does user receive? Success states? Error states?]

### Error Messages
- [What error messages are shown to users?]
- [Are error messages clear, actionable, non-technical?]

### Discoverability & Notifications
- **Discovery**: How will users find or learn about this functionality? (e.g., onboarding, in-app prompt, email, release notes)
- **Alert Center**: Are there user actions or security events related to this feature that should surface in the Alert Center?
- **Notifications**: What notifications should support this feature?
  - In-product notifications: [describe]
  - Email notifications: [describe]

### Accessibility

## Implementation Checklist
> Specific files, components, and changes required. Be explicit.

### Files to Modify

> Note: Bitwarden's server lives in a **separate repository** (`bitwarden/server`). Cross-repo PRs must be coordinated and merged in dependency order (server first, then clients).

**Client repos** (`bitwarden/clients`):

| File Path | Changes Required |
|-----------|------------------|
| `apps/web/src/components/feature.component.ts` | [Specific changes needed] |
| `libs/common/src/services/feature.service.ts` | [Specific changes needed] |
| `apps/mobile/src/screens/feature.screen.tsx` | [Specific changes needed] |

**Server repo** (`bitwarden/server`):

| File Path | Changes Required |
|-----------|------------------|
| `src/Api/Controllers/FeatureController.cs` | [Specific changes needed] |
| `src/Core/Services/FeatureService.cs` | [Specific changes needed] |

### New Files to Create

| Repo | File Path | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `bitwarden/clients` | `libs/common/src/models/feature.model.ts` | [Data model for feature] |
| `bitwarden/server` | `src/Api/Controllers/FeatureController.cs` | [API endpoint handler] |

### Implementation Pattern
> If a pattern should be applied repeatedly, document it clearly.

```typescript
// BEFORE:
function oldPattern() {
  // [existing code pattern]
}

// AFTER:
function newPattern() {
  // [new code pattern to follow]
}
```

### Database Changes
- **New Tables**: [Table definitions if needed]
- **Schema Modifications**: [Column additions, indexes, constraints]
- **Migration Strategy**: [How to migrate existing data]
