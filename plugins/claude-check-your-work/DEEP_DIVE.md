# 🤿 Deep Dive

## 📚 Information Architecture

This plugin is written with a strict information architecture to ensure that the system under evaluation is isolated from implementation knowledge. It uses Claude Code's subagent and skill gating features to enforce this.

Subagents are given a specific set of directions through skill injection, which inserts the evaluator's skills directly into its system prompt. Guidance from the main agent is fed in as a user prompt. Since interactivity isn't possible and the main agent cannot read the evaluator skills, the evaluation criteria should reliably override agent input.

The subagent returns its data to the main agent. Feedback directly relevant to the agent task is typically accepted, after which the agent returns control to its operator.

### 🔄 The FIXME feedback loop

The main agent tends to act on findings that align with its current task and discard the rest. FIXME instructions in the check-your-work skill capture deferred feedback so it isn't lost.

The health-evaluator subagent looks for `FIXME` comments as a strong signal for health hazards. Technical debt in one evaluation can, thus, compound in the next.

### 🧑‍🏫 Evaluator subagent design

The subagents are intentionally concise. Each configures a persona and establishes high-level objectives. The bulk of their instructions are in skill definitions. Subagents with skill imports are used to control the criteria and capabilities available to the agent.

Forked skills are avoided in evaluators because guide skills are expected to have general utility spanning evaluator boundaries. Injecting these skills directly into the subagent's system prompt ensures efficacy can be measured reliably.

### 🧠 Skill design

| Skill | Invocation | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| [`evaluate-documentation`](./skills/evaluate-documentation/SKILL.md) | subagent import | Criteria and report template for documentation quality review |
| [`evaluate-health`](./skills/evaluate-health/SKILL.md) | subagent import | Criteria and report template for structural health review |
| [`evaluate-unit-tests`](./skills/evaluate-unit-tests/SKILL.md) | subagent import | Criteria and report template for unit test design review |
| [`guide-on-situational-awareness`](./skills/guide-on-situational-awareness/SKILL.md) | automatic | Guide for tracing data flow, message passing, localized text, and recurring patterns |

> The `guide-on-situational-awareness` skill includes tracing methodologies for localized text and message passing in the Bitwarden `clients` repository. If you develop a new tracing methodology for a different area of the codebase, consider contributing it as a resource under this skill.

#### `evaluate-*` Skills

These skills form a skill library for subagents. Importing into a subagent is the only supported invocation method — both user invocation and model invocation are disabled. An agent implementing a change must never invoke an `evaluate-*` skill directly, because that agent is prone to rationalize away the skill's advice. The import requirement ensures the subagent has the skill text and provides isolation from the implementing agent's context.

Evaluate skills never reference subagents.

#### `guide-*` Skills

Guide skills are excluded from the user-invocable list. They are designed for Claude to read automatically and may be used by subagents or the main agent.

Guide skills never reference subagents.
